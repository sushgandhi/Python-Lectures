# Introduction

Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. 

Python is easy to pick as a programming language even if you're completely new to programming.

# Installation

Mac OS X and Linux comes pre installed with python. Windows users can download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ .

Please don't use the defualt python from Mac OSX and Linux. Download a fresh install. For beginers, Anaconda is the recommended easy path of installation.


# Anaconda

Download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Anaconda is completely free and includes more than 300 python packages. Both python 2.7 and 3.x options are available.

Windows Users. Please make sure to set environent variable after Anaconda installation

By Default Anaconda is installed on the following locatio in windows - 

C:\Users\<<user-name>>\Anaconda3\
  
Following entries need to be set - 
 
  C:\Users\<<user-name>>\Anaconda3\Scripts\ </br>
  C:\Users\<<user-name>>\Anaconda3\Library\ </br>
  C:\Users\<<user-name>>\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\ </br>

To install IPython run,
<<This is only needed if not using Anaconda>>

$ pip install ipython[all]
This will install all the necessary dependencies for the notebook, qtconsole, tests etc.

Installation from unofficial distributions

Installing all the necessary libraries might prove troublesome. Anaconda comes pre packaged with all the necessary python libraries and also IPython.

 
# Notebooks
 Notebooks are one of key piece of Python Ecosystem that enables us to quickly see feedback and iterate.
